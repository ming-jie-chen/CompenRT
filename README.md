# CompenRT
## Introduction
This is PyTorch implementation of the paper‚ÄúReal-Time High-Resolution Projector Compensation‚Äù.

        
## Datasets
The high resolution compensation datasets: One is the CompenHR public dataset and the other is the new high-resolution dataset we capture.

## Usage
   1. Clone this repo:
  
     git clone https://github.com/ming-jie-chen/CompenRT
     
   2. This project provides two versions of the input resolution: one 256 and one 512, which represent the model with the input of the photometric compensation subnetwork at 256√ó256 and 512√ó512 resolutions, 
      respectively, and you can train:
      
     cd CompenRT/src/python  
     
   3. Download dataset and extract to ‚Äòdata/‚Äô
     
   4. Start visdom by typing:
      
     visdom

   5. Run train_CompenRT.py to produce results:
      
     python train_CompenRT.py
