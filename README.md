# CompenRT
## Introduction
This is PyTorch implementation of the paper‚ÄúReal-Time High-Resolution Projector Compensation‚Äù.

        
## Datasets
* [Full compensation](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1XblKFnsIBhjd2sK7aQCNDA?pwd=qnh5) (19 setups,same as [CompenHR](https://github.com/cyxwang/CompenHR) dataset)


## Usage
   1. Clone this repo:
  
     git clone https://github.com/ming-jie-chen/CompenRT
     
   2. This project provides two versions of the input resolution: CompenRT (256->1024) and CompenRT (512->1024), which represent the model with the input of the photometric compensation subnetwork at 256√ó256 and 512√ó512 resolutions, 
      respectively, and you can train:
      
     cd CompenRT/src/python  
     
   3. Download CompenRT [benchmark dataset](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1XblKFnsIBhjd2sK7aQCNDA?pwd=qnh5) and extract to [‚Äòdata/‚Äô](https://github.com/ming-jie-chen/CompenRT/tree/master/data)
     
   4. Start visdom by typing:
      
     visdom

   5. Open [`train_compenRT.py`](src/python/train_compenRT.py) and set which GPUs to use. An example is shown below, we use GPU 0.
   `os.environ['CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES'] = '0'`

   6. Run [`train_compenRT.py`](src/python/train_compenRT.py) to reproduce benchmark results. To visualize the training process in **visdom** (slower), you need to set `plot_on=True`.
   
     python train_compenRT.py
